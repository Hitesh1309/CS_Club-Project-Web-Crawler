# CS_Club-Project-Web-Crawler
This repository consists of the CS club project Web Crawler

In the Beautiful-soup.py we scrap the data about the jobs containing python as an requirement from the website "https://www.timesjobs.com".
The above code displays the Company name, Required skills and more info about the job which is posted only a few days ago (only the recent ones).
It stores the info about each job in a seperate file and it runs once in every 10 minutes.
